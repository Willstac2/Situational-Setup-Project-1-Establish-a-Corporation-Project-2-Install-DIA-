Introduction:

It is the year 2024. You have a great idea for a product that you know will become a success. You have decided to start this company. You will begin small with yourself as the only employee working from your home. It MUST be a physical product that is manufactured and not just a service.

For this assignment, you are to give your company a name and you are to describe what the product is. This cannot be a real or existing company (with the ONLY exception being if it is an actual company that you started on your own prior to taking this course).

This product can be anything. It can be hand painted bow ties. The product can be scented candles or even framed pictures of your customer superimposed next to their favorite movie star. The only requirement is that the product requires some physical parts that will necessitate raw material coming in and a finished product being delivered.

VERY IMPORTANT: It MUST be a product you can make or do on your own in your house. So this excludes making a new electric automobile or sneakers or a new cell phone. It must realistically be a product a person could actually produce. You will lose marks if the TA determines it is unrealistic that the product you choose could be made by a single person working out of their home.

You MUST to do an internet search (Google or Ask or Yahoo, etc.) to ensure the company name does not already exist. This is very important.

Throughout this course, your company will grow in size and sales. As your company grows, so will your Information Systems.

Future assignments for CS 1032 will contain questions about your expanding needs based on material we will be covering in class. These questions will include not only your decisions, but how and/or why you made them.
